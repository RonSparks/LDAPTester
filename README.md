# LDAPTester
Small Winform C# app to test LDAP and AD connections.

I need to deploy a small app to a remove IT  team to test LDAP connections to an AD server.  I don't have access to the server, and I need to know that my LDAP code, which works against the free testing LDAP server located at ldap.forumsys.com, will work in the remote environment.

The purpose of this code is to create a quick and light LDAP un/pwd authentication, with no other function.  It will be modified and updated as necessary until it works properly in the remote environment, upon which time it will get integrated into the real solution.
